        <img src="images/traveling.jpg" alt="Picture of Oregon" id="img-oregon">
        <p>I absolutely love traveling. I have already been to many beautiful places such as Martinique, Croatia, Italy etc.<br> One day I'd like to visit USA, more specifically Oregon. Since I had seen the movie Postman with Kevin Costner I can't wait to see Oregon!</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>During my bachelor's degree I studied ancient history and specifically Ancient Rome, nowadays I aim at Middle Ages and my master's thesis focuses on the image of wolf throughout middle ages. </p>
        <p>Degree from history is not for employment but for pure joy of learning the past and trying to understand people from then and now.</p>

        <h2>Literature</h2>
        <p>This interest is connected with my love for history. Many greatest books are simply about life and culture of people it is writing about. Personally I also like fantasy and sci-fi literature. It is amazing to think about space traveling and colonization of Mars.</p>
